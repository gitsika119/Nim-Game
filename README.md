# Nim Game
<b>Summary:</b>
<p>Nim is a mathematical game in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from one or multiple piles of objects (e.g., one or multiple piles of coins). On each turn, a player must remove at least one object (e.g., one coin), and depending on the version of the game, there would be some constraints on the maximum number of objects to remove. This game allows one to remove one to number of objects minus one objects. The general goal is to take the last object.</p>
